# Living in Costa Rica

Costa Rica had always been the fantasy dreamland I grew up hoping to one day experience. After covid hit and I got laid off from my logistical sales job, I decided now was the right time to go visit Costa Rica. 

##Jaguar Rescue Center

I am an avid animal lover. I love animals of _all_ kinds. While living in Costa Rica, I was blessed with the opportunity to volunteer at the Jaguar Rescue Center, located just outside of Puerto Viejo on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Some of my daily responsibilities included the following:

*Transporting the howler monkeys out to their rainforest enclosure. 
*Clean monkey enlosures at the center.
*Replace and enrich enclosues with various plants and tree branches taken from the rainforest.
*Prepare food for howler monkeys and sloths.
*Retrieve monkeys from the rainforest enclosure for dinner time.
*Say hi to all the other animals
